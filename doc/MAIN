# DOCUMENTATION:
## Update to the architecture. 
- To make good use of variables and make the code more readable:
	- assign global variables which functions assign values to
	- assign functions to act on those global variables
	- as i then iterate through a loop, all i have to do is assign the specific instance of 'x' to the global variable and then run the global macro/functions
