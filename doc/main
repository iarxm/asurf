# DOCUMENTATION:
## Update to the architecture. 
- To make good use of variables and make the code more readable:
	- assign global variables which functions assign values to
	- assign functions to act on those global variables
	- as i then iterate through a loop, all i have to do is assign the specific instance of 'x' to the global variable and then run the global macro/functions


# tags
## NOTE
- Use "$1" instead of $nnn for passing filename to functions. Will allow for greater future cross compatibility with other file managers..
- Pass $nnn as argument to the script itself..

# FUNCTIONS

## _f_ext

## _f_mt
 - remove extension and unique id from filename string
- Sname.Rrating.Nnotation .zX all as separate variables 
	- better for manipulation..
- note: go from tag_a to tags to create clarity in the flow of the code


## f_id_load
- DESCRIPTION: Load code and associated files
1. Load file code (P12345..) as variable 
	- and check is a camera file and exisits
2. List all files associated with the unique file code
	- ie screenshots, contact cards, note files, etc..
	- usually distinct by the file extension..

## _tg_add
- LOAD: meta strings
- INPUT: read meta tags; Contruct new meta string
- Loop over each file associated with unique id
	- extract base and ext
	- add new tag meta info to middle
	- construct new file name
	- Rename file

### _print_id_new
- if id > 4 digits, cut to 4

- Load code and associated files into memeory
- Match the whole code of 4 to 7 digits in length

# _f_clone
- DUPLICATE MP4 file associated with unique id
    - For clips with multiple waves/surfers
	- Just for one file, to just clone the video
	- TODO: a way of cutting the clip from mpv..?
