# anotr

## TODO: 
- UPDATE THIS TO UNIVERSAL COMPATIBILITY?
- Rather than including a 'tag_note' just add the note to the end of the 'tag-rating' dialog? No, keep tag_note
- Notes will eventually be replaced by an actual file with notes referencing to the P.. id; In progress
- And possibly use single letter abbreviations for full name folders..
- And create if cases for use with contact sheet files, where if the file is a contact sheet, the operations are on both the contact sheet and the file..


# tags
## TODO
- Remove all PWD commands in favour of absolute path manipulations..
- Integrate new tags into already existing meta tags more fluently
		- Ie, add all S tags together and so on..

## TODO:
- call functions from this file via aliase scripts
- Simplifies development by centralising the code
