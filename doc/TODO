# general
## Universality
- Restructure functions so they are more self containted
	- Easier readabilitiy
	- Input data, output data
	- assign the output data to specific variables..
- Begin converting bash code scripts


# anotr

## TODO: 
- UPDATE THIS TO UNIVERSAL COMPATIBILITY?
- Rather than including a 'tag_note' just add the note to the end of the 'tag-rating' dialog? No, keep tag_note
- Notes will eventually be replaced by an actual file with notes referencing to the P.. id; In progress
- And possibly use single letter abbreviations for full name folders..
- And create if cases for use with contact sheet files, where if the file is a contact sheet, the operations are on both the contact sheet and the file..


# tags
## TODO
	- Remove PWD commands in favour of absolute path manipulations..
	- Integrate new tags into already existing meta tags more fluently
		- Ie, add all S tags together and so on..

## TODO:
- call functions from this file via aliase scripts
- Simplifies development by centralising the code


# msurf

## TODO:
### TIER1:
- COLOR: Add color to printf funcs. Create visual diff between eg rsync output and bash script outp.
- SORT: Read input to name the dir when sorting by am/pm
	- String reads, eg: 'level' 'location' 'etc', similar to tagging func
- Add a way to save all output to a second stream that goes into a log file..
	- So i can see what's occuring when a run of the script returns errors or unexpected results.
- future - create directories for input if they're not made already

### TIER2:	
	- Make all contained functions functional
	- Publish scripts to public via github
	- Complete all sub- todo sections witin each function

### init
- improving the regexp on 'init' - to only match sd cards ..

### moving scripts
- create a 'cp' variant. 
- and an option to choose an sd when sd card label not in pattern
- remove sd_a and sd constructions??
- put them in a higher level script??
- Remove functions above??
	- overkill?
	- one occurrence
	- Are loops required for 'mv' and 'rsync' commands??
- Remove fifo and 'src' definitions??

### sorting
- Generalise to absolute filepaths so the sort functions are generalised and can be easily utilised within other use cases.
- make it applicable to context..
	- sd cards, 
	- or xds/.../?
- make this more general to other cameras etc..
	- IE beyond PANA.. pattern matching
	- add option to add suffix to dir name...	
		- IE for session metaday (loc.level.. etc)

### _mv2client
- RYSNC OR MV?
	- rsync copies and removes
	- mv renames if on same filesystem
	- which is better option in most cases..

## xTODO:sd
x- Turn sd_a evaluation into a conditional test.. 
x- Only set it if it exisits.. 
x- Rather than nesting two tests in the first 'if'..
