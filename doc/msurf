# CODE DOCUMENTATION: msurf functions

# init

# sd
## _test_sd_exists
1. TEST: glob "zm/sd.*" exists, 
    1a. TRUE: print 'SD DIR';
    1b. FALS: exit w code 1

# _test_sd_fifo (older)
1. Assing vars as inputted sd as absolute path
2. TST: if input string exists, and whether forms a dir
	a. TRU: src - set DCIM with inputted var
 	b. FAL: auto scan for SD pattern
 		- Exists: set as src..
3. TST: Exit if no DCIM dir..
4. Ouput src to fifo


# MOVING SCRIPTS

## _mv_sd
### DESCRIPTION:BASICS:
- Takes a sub dir in xds/. And an sd as zm/.. 
- Copys files between them and then moves the src dirs as a backup version in sd/bk/..

1. Test SD and import $src
	b. Double check src is a dir
2. rsync mv


### NOTE
 - Assign Vars: $1 as "zm/.." structure

## _mv2client_x

### DESCRIPTION:
- Moves file to clients profile dir

### STEPS:
- 1. Takes a client dir; 2. Takes a file, Calc it's containing dir
- 3 - Moves the file to the same containing dir name, to within the client dir
- Using full pathnames as input for universality of the functions..
- eg: dsmv client.x ~/xds/cj.ddb/dylan.craig dyl $PWD


rsync -avP --delete-source $src $dst


# MV SD X SCRIPT

## _sd_all () { #1. main

## META

Automating all currently developed moving functions that are default
- keep this a function so that the 'dst' variable can be changed easily as different cases potentially..

## STEPS:

1. Test SD exists and set $src
2. Sort videos,preliminary, into dated dir's
3. Move to xds
4. Sync to cloud. 
5. 2nd sync later will just be renaming after evaluating and tagging files.


# SORTING

## _sort_date_dir_root

### BAICS:
- Take a root dir with 'sub-dirs' of eg 'PANA..' to sort into 'dated dirs'
- Uses sort_date_dir to sort each separate dir in ls
- Which uses sort_date_file to sort each specific file within each specific subdir

### STEPS:

1. Check dirs exist
2. ..

### NOTES

- IF pattern is limited to specific things, that pattern can be used as a way to regulate what gets sorted..
- input is DCIM/ or ...
- Can be made more efficient by sharing variables such as dir_i between other functions. At the moment to generalise I may be calculating components of names twice.
- Currently using 'PANA' to limit to files within that dir, created by PANAsonic camera..

2. Looping through dirs in '$src_ls'
- i:1-7 for 7 days of week
- Test: if any files left in dir
	- TRUE: cd to parent and mv to trash


# Date sorting

## sort_date_file () {

- TAKES ABSOLUTE FILE Path and converts into a folder with systematically dated dir
